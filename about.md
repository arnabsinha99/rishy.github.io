I am a Senior Undergraduate Student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at SMVDU, Jammu, India. 

I love Data and the whole ecosystem of Data Science, Statistics, Machine Learning and AI, in general. Having gained a lot from Open Source World, I always try to do my bit by contributing back, mainly on [Github](https://github.com/rishy) and by spreading the word about FOSS. As a result I also got an opportunity to work as a Google Summer Code Intern for the year 2014, back then I worked with "[Mifos]('http://mifos.org/')" to develop a [Batch-API](https://github.com/rishy/mifosx/tree/Batch-API) for Mifos Platform. 

I am always hungry for new Data oriented problems( and of course for French Fries ;) ), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/users/248945/rishabh-shukla) is an awesome restaurant, isn't it? :D. Currently, I am looking for better work opportunities to apply my knowledge and in-process learn more about the awesome world of Data Science. We can get in touch at my [contact page](/contact/).

This Web-log is a platform to share some of my thoughts regarding Statistics, Data Science and ML. Your feedback is always welcomed.

Thanks :)
