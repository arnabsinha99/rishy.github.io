A Deep Learning Engineer/Researcher and CTO with a New Delhi Based Startup, [Neuron](http://neuronme.com/).

My work includes developing Neuron's Natural Language Processing Platform based on state of the art Deep Learning Models. Having gained a lot from Open Source World, I always try to do my bit by contributing back, mainly on [Github](https://github.com/rishy) and by spreading the word about FOSS. I have also been a Google Summer Code Intern in 2014, back then I worked with [Mifos]('http://mifos.org/') to develop a [Batch-API](https://github.com/rishy/mifosx/tree/Batch-API) for Mifos Platform. 

I would love to talk about any research work and projects, you might be working on, in the field of Deep Learning. We can get in touch through my [contact page](/contact/).
