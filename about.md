I am a Deep Learning Researcher and CTO at a New Delhi Based Startup, [Neuron](http://neuronme.com/).

My work includes developing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Platform of Neuron which is coupled with state of the art Deep Learning Techniques. Having gained a lot from Open Source World, I always try to do my bit by contributing back, mainly on [Github](https://github.com/rishy) and by spreading the word about FOSS. As a result I also got an opportunity to work as a Google Summer Code Intern in 2014, back then I worked with [Mifos]('http://mifos.org/') to develop a [Batch-API](https://github.com/rishy/mifosx/tree/Batch-API) for Mifos Platform. 

I am always looking out for better research opportunities and projects in the field of Deep Learning. We can get in through my [contact page](/contact/).

Thanks :)
